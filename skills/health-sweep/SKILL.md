# Health Sweep

Audit the **Claude Code dev environment** for the current project: runaway processes, per-turn overhead, hook hygiene, and secret-access exposure. Every measurement is read-only. **Never kill a process, edit a hook, or change a config without first showing the user the exact command/diff and getting explicit approval.**

This is the environment-and-infra counterpart to `memory-audit` (which only touches the memory store). Use `memory-audit` for MEMORY.md consolidation; use this for processes, hooks, config footprint, and secrets.

Follow the steps in order.

## Step 1 — Run the read-only sweep

Run the bundled diagnostics from the project root:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/health-sweep/sweep.sh
```

It never mutates anything and reports four sections with measured numbers:

1. **Test/build processes** — every jest/vitest/tsc/eslint/stylelint/`next build`/lint-staged process with PID, PPID, elapsed time, %CPU, %MEM, **and its parent command**. Flags any older than 600s as likely stale. IDE-owned helpers (WebStorm/JetBrains) are filtered out so genuine CLI runs and hook pile-ups stand out. The pile-up signature is a long-lived jest process whose parent is `lint-staged`, a hook `.sh`, or PID 1 (orphaned).
2. **Per-turn overhead** — word/byte counts of every file re-sent to the model each request (MEMORY.md index + all three CLAUDE.md layers) with a running total, plus each settings file's size and allow/deny rule counts.
3. **Hook audit** — every PreToolUse/PostToolUse/UserPromptSubmit/Stop hook across all four settings layers, each tagged with flags: `[SPAWNS-TEST/BUILD]`, `[POSTTOOLUSE-HEAVY: can pile up]`, `[MISSING-SCRIPT]`, `[NOT-EXECUTABLE]`.
4. **Secret-access exposure** — Read-tool deny coverage per settings file, whether `block-secret-access.sh` exists/is-executable/is-wired into a Bash PreToolUse matcher (the Read deny rules do **not** cover Bash — the hook is the real guard), and any broad file-reading Bash commands (`cat`, `less`, `env`…) in allow-lists that could bypass the Read deny.

Read the full output before continuing. Do not summarise from memory — the report must quote the actual numbers.

## Step 2 — Interpret against the baselines

- **Processes:** a single short-lived jest chain (elapsed seconds, descending PIDs from a zsh/npx parent) is a normal run in progress — not a leak. Flag only: (a) multiple stale jest processes, (b) any jest/test process parented by `lint-staged` or a hook script, or (c) orphans (PPID 1). A long-lived `next-server` is the dev server — note it, don't alarm.
- **Overhead:** total always-loaded context healthy under ~3000 words; MEMORY.md index alone under ~800 words. If MEMORY.md is over, recommend `memory-audit`. Flag any one CLAUDE.md that has ballooned.
- **Hooks:** a `[POSTTOOLUSE-HEAVY]` hook spawning Jest is the known pile-up cause — call it out as high priority. `[MISSING-SCRIPT]`/`[NOT-EXECUTABLE]` hooks silently no-op and must be flagged. A PreToolUse gate (lint-staged on commit, the guard scripts) is expected and fine.
- **Secrets:** the guard must be present, executable, **and** wired into a `Bash` matcher. Any broad file-reader in an allow-list is a real exposure. Note when a settings layer has no deny rules but is covered by a more-global layer (deny rules don't need to be repeated per layer).

## Step 3 — Write the evidence-based report to the vault

Save to `vault/Reports/health-sweep-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (resolve the dir with `bash ~/.claude/skills/health-sweep/sweep.sh --reports-dir`). The report is the deliverable, not chat output — keep the chat response short and just give the path plus the top findings.

Structure:

```
# Health Sweep — <project> — <date>

## Summary
<2-3 lines: overall state, count of issues by severity>

## 1. Processes
<measured table; which are normal vs flagged, with PID + elapsed + parent>

## 2. Per-turn overhead
<measured word/byte totals; verdict vs the ~3000 / ~800 baselines>

## 3. Hooks
<each hook, its flags, and whether it's expected or a problem>

## 4. Secret-access
<deny coverage, guard status, any exposures>

## Proposed fixes (ranked by impact)
<see Step 4 — leave this as proposals only>
```

Every claim must cite a measured number from the sweep. No guesses — if something wasn't measured, say so.

## Step 4 — Propose scoped fixes, ranked — but change nothing yet

In the report's final section and in the chat, list fixes **ranked by impact** (highest first). For each: the problem, the precise fix, and its blast radius. If the user invoked with `report`, stop after writing the report — proposals only, no offer to apply.

**Hard rule — nothing destructive without a shown diff and explicit approval:**

- **Killing a process:** show the exact `kill <PID>` command and the full `ps` line it targets. Get a yes before running it. Never `kill -9` or `pkill` by name (could hit the IDE or an unrelated run).
- **Removing/editing a hook or settings rule:** show the exact before/after of the JSON or script as a diff. Get a yes before editing. Edit the narrowest layer that fixes it.
- **Deleting/trimming a config or memory file:** look at the file first; if its content contradicts how it was described, surface that instead of trimming. Get a yes.

Apply approved fixes one at a time, smallest blast radius first, and re-run `sweep.sh` afterward to confirm the issue is gone. Report the before/after numbers.

## Notes

- The IDE here is **WebStorm** — its node helpers are filtered from the process list on purpose; never propose killing a WebStorm/JetBrains process.
- The `vault/` directory is a gitignored symlink to a personal Obsidian vault — the report lands there, not in the repo. No commit needed.
- This skill never touches application code. It only inspects processes and Claude Code config, and only mutates them on explicit approval.
- If `vault/Reports` doesn't resolve (no vault in this project), tell the user and offer to print the report inline instead.
